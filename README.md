# Project Structure 

`index.qmd` is the slide deck. Use the "visual editor" within RStudio for the easiest time editing this document. `assets/` holds any images you may want to include, as well as `custom.scss`, which is how we can change the styling of the slides and add additional style elements. 

A new quarto slide is created with each level 2 header ("##"). Learn more about [Quarto in the docs](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) (which are actually .qmd files themselves)!
